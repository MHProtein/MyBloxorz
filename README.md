A bloxorz replica

Used for Hit Academy assignment

Just two levels are added for this project is to demonstrate code.

A* algorithm is implemented in the project to solve the game. However, when there are trigger blocks placed in the level, the algorithm fails to work properly.

There are some seemingly stupid code in the solution and im just too lazy to modify, they are the manifestation of my attempt to make it work in a level with trigger blocks and its corresponding removable blocks(hopefully this is the name).

Will give another shot to solve the issue and optimize the code when I've got some spare time.
